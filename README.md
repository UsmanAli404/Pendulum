# Pendulum

A visually-rich and interactive pendulum simulation built using p5.js. This simulation not only models the oscillatory motion of a pendulum but also visualizes the physical forces at play, including weight, velocity, and the component of gravitational force.

## üß† Interactivity

This simulation provides rich and intuitive interactivity features to help users explore the dynamics of a pendulum:

### üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Controls
- **Drag the bob**: Click and drag the pendulum bob to a new position. When released, it will begin oscillating from that position.
- **Mouse-over feedback**: Hovering over elements like the pendulum string or bob provides smooth transitions and accurate positioning.

### üéØ Real-Time Physics Feedback
- **Live Arrow Updates**:
  - **Weight vector** (blue): Constant downward gravitational force acting on the bob.
  - **Tangential velocity** (yellow): Always perpendicular to the string and changes direction during oscillation.
  - **Cosine component of gravity** (orange): Points along the string; changes magnitude based on current angle.
- **Dashed Construction Lines**:
  - **Central Line**: Vertical dashed line helps visualize angular deviation.
  - **Top Reference Line**: Helps maintain context for horizontal displacement and maximum amplitude.

### üîÅ Motion Control & Physics
- **Friction factor**: The simulation models energy loss using a customizable damping factor.
- **Real-time equations**: Angular velocity and acceleration are computed on every frame using realistic physics.
